# Sample Clojure web api

[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/evg-tso/sample-donkey-api/actions/workflows/push_ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/evg-tso/sample-donkey-api/actions/workflows/push_ci.yml)

This is a sample Clojure web api that will:
- Display a [swagger](https://swagger.io/) page.
- Validate or reject http requests based on a schema.
- Do an async http request to resolve the client's IP address.
- Map the request to a Kafka message.
- Enqueue and publish that message.
- Integration tests, relying on [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org).
