This is a sample Clojure http server that will:
- Display a [swagger](https://swagger.io/) page.
- Validate or reject http requests based on a schema.
- Do an async http request to resolve the client's IP address.
- Map the request to a Kafka message.
- Enqueue and publish that message.
- Integration tests, relying on [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org).
